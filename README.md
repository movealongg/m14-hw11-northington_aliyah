## Issues
I had issues with the original sample URL for the API. I thought I was
going crazy! I'm glad it wasn't just me and that we got it figured out.

I also forgot to link my js file in my html (rookie mistake).

## Resources
I used the Big Book of Javascript and https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/.
